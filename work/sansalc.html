    <div style="margin: 0;" class="workleft"><b>Project Explanation</b></div> 
    <div><i> For this branding class, we had to choose another classmate's brand guideline (see <a href="pump.html" class="underline">Pump</a> for the one I created) and make applications of the brand. <br>With a group, each member had to separately make an application for the brand, while together the group had to ensure all the applications were cohesive with each other.</i></div>
    <div class="workleft" style="margin: 0;"><b>Brand Application Presentation</b></div> 
    <div>Below is the final presentation, where we pitched and showcased the applications of our brand. <b>I led the design of the presentation deck</b></div>

  <div class="work">
    <div class="workleft" style="margin: 0;"><b>My Role</b></div> 
    <div>I took on the position of <b>Design Director</b> which involves ensuring that brand applications and visual details followed the rules of the brand guidelines.</div>
    <div class="workleft" style="margin: 0;"><b>What I Contributed</b></div> 
    <div>I <b>designed</b> the "mocktail recipe book" for SansAlc. In addition, ideated the <b>language</b> used across our applications as a part of my role of Design Director. I created titles/wordmarks that were iterations of SansAlc for each brand application: SansCrafted for the recipe book, Sansology for the mocktail class.</div>

    <div class="workleft" style="margin: 0;"><b>Skills</b></div> 
    <div>Document designed in <b>Adobe InDesign</b>. <b>Adobe Photoshop</b> for the mockups. Used online resource "Publuu" to make a "preview" mockup of the recipe book. </div>

  <div class="work">
    <div class="workleft" style="margin: 0;"><b>Group's work</b></div> 
    <div>As seen in the presentation above, my peers made 1) e-commerce website for SansAlc that hosted all the products and brand values, 2) 3D render of a mocktail class space, and 3) a Gift Box to be given in the mocktail class but also available for purchase</div>

    <div class="workleft" style="margin: 0;"><b>Personal Recognition</b></div> 
    <div>I pitched the idea to my group to create a website and do our final presentation through the website instead of a deck. This resulted in positive feedback from our classmates in how cohesive our applications seem because they were presented together on a website. <br>I also received feedback on how "clean" my design of the recipe book was, and received no critics on how to improve my recipe book.</div>
