    <div><i> For this branding class, we had to choose another classmate's brand guideline (see <a href="pump.html"></a> for the one I created) and make applications of the brand. With a group, each member had to make an application for the brand, while also ensuring all the applications were cohesive with each other.</i></div>

    <div class="workleft" style="margin: 0;"><b>My Role</b></div> 
    <div>I made the "mocktail recipe book" for SansAlc. In addition, I took the initiative to be the one to ideate the <b>language</b> used across our applications. Therefore, I created titles/wordmarks that were iterations of SansAlc for each brand application - SansCrafted for the recipe book, Sansology for the mocktail class.</div>

    <div class="workleft" style="margin: 0;"><b>Skills</b></div> 
    <div>Document designed in <b>Adobe InDesign</b>. <b>Adobe Photoshop</b> for the mockups. Used online resource "Publuu" to make a "preview" mockup of the recipe book. </div>

    <div class="workleft" style="margin: 0;"><b>Personal Recognition</b></div> 
    <div>I presented the idea to my group to create a website and do our final presentation through the website instead of a Figma deck. This resulted in positive feedback from others in how cohesive our applications seem because they were presented on a website. <br>I also received feedback on how "clean" my design of the recipe book was, and received no critics on how to improve my recipe book.</div>

    <div>Between drafts, we received design feedback from classmates and the professor. The drafts can be seen in this Figma progress file <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/M4hYajGdDktZUlRIyG94sC/SANSALC-Project-2?type=design&node-id=321%3A2&mode=design&t=WwHHs02WyHyEkrxR-1" style="text-decoration: underline;" target="__blank">here</a></div>
