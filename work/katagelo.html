    <div style="margin: 0;" class="workleft"><b>Project Explanation</b></div> 
    <div>For my Senior Project/Thesis, I created an online resource for Social Anxiety Disorder.
      <br><br><i>Katagelo is a one-stop, modern, online resource for social anxiety disorder. Katagelo not only provides information on what social anxiety is, but also has interactive online exercises for accessible support.</i>
    <br><br>Katagelo includes an informational website and interactive exercises to help users work through their social anxiety. 
  </div>

    <div class="workleft" style="margin: 0;"><b>Skills</b></div> 
    <div>○ Coded website from scratch using <b>HTML/CSS/JS</b> <br>○ Exercises made with <b>Twine (Harlowe)</b> and <b>HTML/CSS</b><br>○ Used <b>Figma</b> for creating website <b>animations</b> and to draft website design and copy<br>○ Completed <b>research</b> on mental health resources and Cognitive Behavorial Therapy techniques for Exercise<br>○ Multiple rounds of <b>User testing</b> on the Exercises</div>

    <div style="margin: 0;" class="workleft"><b>Live Project Links</b></div> 
    <div><a href="https://aysabellegalvez.com/Katagelo/katagelo.html" class="underline" target="__blank">The Website</a> (only compatible with desktop, not mobile)
      <br><a href="https://aysabellegalvez.com/Katagelo/Katagelo1.html" class="underline" target="__blank">The Exercise</a></div>

    <div style="margin: 0;" class="workleft"><b>The Website</b></div> 
    <div>The Katagelo website is meant to be a host for the exercises - but also to showcase my <b>web design</b> and <b>HTML/CSS/JS</b> skills. The Katagelo website introduces users to what Social Anxiety Disorder is, including sections like "What It's Like" or "Safety Behaviors." Only compatible on desktop currently, the website has a hybrid scroll (scrolls both horizontally and vertically, but the user only needs to scroll down) and little animations to make the website fun and informative.</div>

  <div class="workleft" style="margin: 0;"><b>The Exercises</b></div> 
  <div>The exercise is made using a text-based, game-making platform called <b>Twine</b>. Although it's not supposed to be treated as a game, I believe Twine was the perfect platform to create these exercises as it allowed me to create different paths and the users can interact.</div>

  <div>The [5] categories of anxious thinking (as I've found through research) is how this game is organized. Depending on the category the user believes their anxious thinking follows, there are a series of questions/prompts that adheres to that category and allows the users to work through their thoughts in a somewhat personalized way.<br><br>Since this exercise is not actually responsive (the computer can not comprehend and respond to what the user inputs), the categories were how I worked around this technical limiation.</div>

    <div>It is required to present our Senior Project in a science-fair styled showcase called the <a href="http://idm.show/S2024/project.html?id=ayg3081" class="underline" target="__blank"> IDM Showcase</a>. On one monitor, I showed the informational website to introduce social anxiety. On the other monitor, I had the video demo of the exercise to help explain the project. Additionally, I printed out a QR code for people to try the live version of the exercise themselves if they wanted to.
    <br><br>I pitched my project <i>sooo</i> many times over the 4 hours, as well as answered questions of viewers who challenged my work. <i>("Who are your competitors? Why this project? Is the exercise actually responsive? How about when people put the wrong answers?")</i></div>
