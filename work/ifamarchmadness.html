    <div><p><i>During my time as Social Media Chair for NYU's Filipino club, my biggest project was "Filipino Food March Madness." In partnership with the Cultural Chair of our E-board, we hosted March Madness, where our Instagram audience voted on their favorite Filipino foods. <br><br> The Cultural Chair organized the food selections and their informative prompts, while I had the role of designing and posting.</i></p></div>

  <div class="workleft"><b>Results</b></div>
  <div><p>This was the most engagement our Instagram had gotten, a consistent voting count of 40-60 daily, as well as many DMs of passionate voters' opinions. 
  <br>The month ended in a big food-eating event where the winner was announced. Because of this, the turn-out for the event was large, about 40 people.</p>
