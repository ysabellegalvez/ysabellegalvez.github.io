<h4>IKEA: Sustainability communication</h4>

	<div class="work">
	<div class="workleft"><b>Project Description</b></div> 
    <div>I was assigned to lead Sustainability communication in the IKEA Elizabeth store. There are two parts to this project: implementing an example from an IKEA store in Slovenia, and updating our current sustainability display in our store entrance. Even though these were pre-designed, I still had to customize these solutions to our store.</div>

  <div class="workleft"><b>Skills</b></div>

    <div class="workleft"><b>The Proposal</b></div>

    <div class="workleft"><b>The Planning</b></div> 
    <div>Over several weeks among other projects, I measured and talked to other functions (Sales, Visual Merchandisers, Carpenters) to create a plan and designs for the project. <br><br>My project had to be implemented <b>in under a week</b>, and this timeline was put into my project plan. <br><br>Below is the full deck for this project.</div>

<h5>Part 1: Sustainability Walls </h5>
    <div class="work">
    <div class="workleft"><b>Project Summary</b></div> 
    <div>This first part of the project was an example taken from an IKEA store in Slovenia. <br><br>It uses vinyl to make a 2D portrayal of rooms in a house, then IKEA products are the 3D aspect, which shows how you can use our products to implement sustainable choices into your home.<br><br>These rooms also have speech bubbles communicating the function.</div>

    <div class="workleft"><b>The Kitchen</b></div> 
    <div>The kitchen was the largest display with <b>5 hours of vinyl installation by me </b> and occassional help from other graphic designers. <br><br>Other functions installed the 3D aspects, such as the drawers and products. </div>

    <div class="workleft"><b>The Bathroom</b></div> 
    <div>This bathroom <i>(more of a laundry room)</i>, was a short 1-hour installation. This is the only display that has <b>sellable products</b> (decided by functions out of my control), a cotton towel (material ethically made) and hooks.</div>
	</div>

	<div class="work">
    <div class="workleft"><b>The Living Room</b></div> 
    <div>The living room has no 3D aspects because the only space for this display was in a walk-way, hence customers will bump into any 3D aspects. A 2-hour vinyl installation job. </div>

<h5>Part 2: Store Entrance Display </h5>
    <div class="work">
    <div class="workleft"><b>Project Summary</b></div> 
    <div>The second part of my project was to update the sustainability display in the store entrance. This design is from IKEA corporate, but I had to customize the design to products our Sales team wanted to feature and the measurements of the space this display will stand.</div>

	<div class="work">
  <div class="workleft"><b>How I made it happen</b></div> 
    <div>I talked with a person from <b>Sales</b> to pick out the products that will be featured. I worked with a <b>Carpenter</b> to paint the green squares, mount the TV, and make a cleat for the circle graphic. A <b>Visual Merchandiser</b> installed the products. And, of course, I <b>installed print and cut vinyl</b>.</div>
