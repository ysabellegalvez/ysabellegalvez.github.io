	<p>Katagelo is a one-stop, modern, online resource for social anxiety disorder. Katagelo not only provides information on what social anxiety is, but also has interactive online exercises for accessible support.
	<p> Katagelo is created by Ysabelle Galvez for her Senior Project at New York University's Integrated Design & Media program (2024). 
	<p> Ysabelle wanted to make this project to provide a modern and accessible resource for social anxiety disorder, and create something she wished she had growing up - based on what she learned from the social anxiety resources she got when she went to college. </p>

I realized that if I had a computer provide prompts that are inspired by CBT, it could help people who don't have access to therapy. It's obviously not a replacement for therapy, but it can teach people the strategies in CBT and also provide a refresher for people who do know about these strategies. It's always useful to have additional external support." </i> <br>- Ysabelle Galvez</p>
