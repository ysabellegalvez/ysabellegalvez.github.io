				NYU's International Filipino Association (IFA) is NYU's Filipino club that is also connected with other colleges throughout the New York City and New Jersey area through an organization called FIND D3 (Filipino Intercollegiate Networking District 3). <p> I am IFA's Social Media Chair for the 2021-22 year and was re-elected for the 2022-23 year as well. I run the social media accounts for IFA (mainly the Instagram) and design the graphics for every club event as well as stay updated on NYU and FIND D3 events on social media to repost and share with our following. Most of the graphics on the Instagram from November 2021 to present are created by me using Canva, Adobe InDesign, Adobe Illustrator, and/or Adobe Photoshop. In addition, I help the other E-board members plan and coordinate club meetings and events.

			<div style="margin-left: 5em;"> 
				The biggest project I did for IFA was a March Madness on Filipino food. In partnership with the Cultural Chair for the club, who gave me all the information, I designed the voting polls and bracket for the March Madness. I created and posted a voting poll daily in March and updated the bracket weekly. I made this all through Adobe InDesign. All the members of the club were very passionate about the voting and winners, making this project very rewarding.

		<h2> Crypto Controllers </h2> <h3> Social Media Management </h3> <h4> <i> January 2022 - February 2022 </i> </h4>

				CryptoControllers (or CPNK) is an NFT startup that I was asked to join to manage the social media. I was recruited through a connection I made through my time at Tally Shot and had no interest in NFTs. As I started working for them, I had to teach myself about the NFT world, especially its social media presence. I learned that the NFT community was based on Twitter, a social media platform I had no experience in. The NFT community, and probably many other Twitter communities, networked and grew their following through Twitter Spaces. I dove into the Twitter Spaces by joining them - not talking at all, only listening. When I got comfortable with the features, I started talking in the Spaces.

			<div>  
				CPNK asked me to make my own personal Twitter to authentically build my own audience that I could later lead to CryptoControllers. This is what I did for most of my time there. I joined Twitter Spaces and talked to other people in the NFT Community. Although my end goal was supposed to shill the company, I built connections by conversing about things unrelated to NFTs and rarely mentioning the main reason I was there. For most of the time I was building my own audience, CryptoControllers hadn't launched yet, so I wasn't allowed to talk about the company anyways. Once the company launched, I posted and reposted about CryptoControllers once or twice a day, in a way not annoy my own audience. Occassionally, I was one of the people that tweeted on CryptoControllers' official Twitter.

		</div>
		<p style="text-align:center; margin-left: 20em; margin-right: 20em;"> Although, it's hard to admit, CPNK was one of the many unsuccessful startups. However, I'm glad I learned a lot from this experience about NFTs, Twitter, and added more to my experience in social media marketing. </p>

			</div>
			<div> 
				At Tallyshot, I was hired as a Digital Marketing Intern, mainly for social media. I ran the Instagram and Tik Tok of Tallyshot. I was given the media, then created captions or edited the content, and posted them at high-performing times. During my time there, the company started a college ambassadors program. I communicated with the ambassadors on how to create good social-media-worthy content. I again edited and published their photos or videos. Additionally, I have designed two mass emails for them using Klayvio. 
				<p> Their first viral Instagram reel (at 7.2 million views) was posted by me. I created and posted their second viral Instagram reel (10.4 million views). Their reels continued to have good traction during my time there. When I first joined the company, the Instagram had 800 followers. When I left, it had more than 3,000.
