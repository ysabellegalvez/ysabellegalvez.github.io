	<h3> Bio </h3>
		<div style="margin-left: 5em; margin-right: 5em;">
	<p>Combining design and marketing, Ysabelle is a Customer Experience Designer, using design thinking and multimedia to improve user experience on a marketing and communications level. She is a senior at New York University majoring in Integrated Design and Media with a minor in Business Studies. 
	<p> She started out in social media marketing, assisting in content creation and professionally managing social media accounts. She has been Social Media Chair for NYUâ€™s Filipino club for the past three years. Before that, she did Instagram and Tik Tok marketing for the shot glass brand, Tally Shot, as well as guided brand ambassadors in content creation. 
	<p> Wanting to branch out from social media, she got more into digital marketing. At her internship at the experimental music distributor, fusetronsound, she helped design emails and product media, and assisted in inventory. Afterwards, she interned at the digital marketing agency, imre, where she did social listening and social media publishing and community management. 
	<p> Now, Ysabelle is currently working at NYU as a Student Experience Design Fellow. As a fellow, she provides design feedback for NYU Marketing and Communications, ensuring that content is digestible for students, and also assisting in this content creation through multiple mediums such as web pages, graphics, and video. She is also an intern at the sustainable fashion brand, Wolven, assisting in creative marketing and campaign analytics. Soon, she will be graduating from NYU in hopes of a job at a design or marketing agency.
